# UX Improvements Implemented

## 1. Clickable Job Addresses

### Frontend Changes:
- **JobsPage.svelte**: 
  - Added `openGPS` function to open Google Maps with the job address
  - Made job addresses clickable with hover effects
  - Address clicks now open the location in Google Maps in a new tab

## 2. Item Nicknames for Display

### Backend Changes:
- **models/item.go**: 
  - Added `Nickname` field to the `Item` struct
  - Updated the `Update` method to handle nickname updates

- **repository/job_repository.go**:
  - Modified `GetJobItems` query to JOIN with items table and fetch nicknames
  - Added nickname field to the scan results

- **repository/item_repository.go**:
  - Updated all SELECT queries (GetByID, List) to include nickname column
  - Modified INSERT query in Create method to include nickname
  - Updated UPDATE query to include nickname field

- **handlers/item_handler.go**:
  - Added nickname field to the Create request struct
  - Implemented logic to update nickname after item creation

### Frontend Changes:
- **types/models.ts**:
  - Added `nickname` field to both `Item` and `JobItem` interfaces

- **JobDetailPage.svelte**:
  - Updated item display to show nickname if available, falling back to name
  - Display format: `{jobItem.nickname || jobItem.name}`

- **ItemsPage.svelte**:
  - Added nickname input field to the item form
  - Added placeholder text: "e.g., 'Wafers' for '4" Recessed LED Lights'"
  - Added help text explaining nicknames are for job cards
  - Display nicknames in the items table with green italic text
  - Nickname field is included in both create and update operations

### Database:
- Migration already exists: `006_add_item_nickname.sql`
- Adds `nickname VARCHAR(255)` column to items table

## How It Works:

1. **Address Navigation**: 
   - Click any job address in the job cards to open it in Google Maps
   - Addresses have hover effects to indicate they're clickable

2. **Item Nicknames**:
   - Go to Items Management page
   - When creating or editing an item, you can add a "Display Name (Nickname)"
   - Example: Item name "4" Recessed LED Lights" can have nickname "Wafers"
   - Nicknames appear on job detail cards for easier reading
   - The actual invoice will still use the full item name
   - Nicknames are optional - items without nicknames display their regular name

## Testing:
1. Test clicking job addresses - they should open in Google Maps
2. Add nicknames to items through the Items Management page
3. View jobs with those items - nicknames should display on job cards
4. Check that invoices still use the full item names (not nicknames)
