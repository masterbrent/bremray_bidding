## Known Issues

### High Priority
1. ~~No backend implementation~~ âœ… Backend fully implemented
2. No authentication system
3. ~~All data is client-side only~~ âœ… All features using real backend
4. ~~Jobs and Templates still using mock data~~ âœ… Connected to backend
5. ~~Company settings using mock data~~ âœ… Connected to backend

### Medium Priority
1. Form validation is minimal
2. No error boundaries
3. Limited accessibility features
4. Need to implement remaining API endpoints

### Low Priority
1. Some TypeScript types could be stricter
2. CSS could be optimized
3. ~~Missing loading animations~~ âœ… Added loading states

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Set up Go backend project
2. Design PostgreSQL schema
3. Implement basic CRUD APIs
4. Add authentication

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Complete backend API
2. Integrate frontend with backend
3. Deploy to Digital Ocean
4. Basic testing

### Long Term (1+ month)
1. Wave integration
2. Advanced reporting
3. Mobile app consideration
4. Multi-company support

## Notes for Next Developer/Claude

1. **Start with**: Backend setup following the structure in CLAUDE.md
2. **Priority**: Get basic CRUD working before adding complex features
3. **Remember**: Keep frontend and backend completely separated
4. **Test**: Each API endpoint before frontend integration
5. **Document**: Update this file after each session
