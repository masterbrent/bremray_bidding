## Metrics

### Code Statistics
- **Frontend Files**: ~25 components/pages
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: 10+
- **Mock API Endpoints**: 15+
- **Lines of Code**: ~3000+ (frontend)

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Page load time: <2s
- [ ] API response time: <200ms
- [ ] Photo upload: <5s per photo
- [ ] Bundle size: <500KB

## Known Issues

### High Priority
1. No backend implementation
2. No authentication system
3. All data is client-side only

### Medium Priority
1. Form validation is minimal
2. No error boundaries
3. Limited accessibility features

### Low Priority
1. Some TypeScript types could be stricter
2. CSS could be optimized
3. Missing loading animations

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Set up Go backend project
2. Design PostgreSQL schema
3. Implement basic CRUD APIs
4. Add authentication

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Complete backend API
2. Integrate frontend with backend
3. Deploy to Digital Ocean
4. Basic testing

### Long Term (1+ month)
1. Wave integration
2. Advanced reporting
3. Mobile app consideration
4. Multi-company support

## Notes for Next Developer/Claude

1. **Start with**: Backend setup following the structure in CLAUDE.md
2. **Priority**: Get basic CRUD working before adding complex features
3. **Remember**: Keep frontend and backend completely separated
4. **Test**: Each API endpoint before frontend integration
5. **Document**: Update this file after each session
