    - Added loading states and error handling
    - Full CRUD operations working end-to-end
- **Architecture Decisions**:
  - Used TDD (Test-Driven Development) throughout
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Service layer for business logic
  - Clean separation of concerns

  - Items feature fully integrated
  - Real data flowing between frontend and backend
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement Job, Template, and Customer models in backend
  - Connect remaining frontend pages to backend
  - Add authentication with JWT
  - Remove all remaining mock data

### Session 3 (Upcoming)
- **Goal**: Backend implementation
- **Tasks**: 
  - Go project setup
  - Database design
  - API development

## Metrics

### Code Statistics
- **Frontend Files**: ~30 components/pages
- **Backend Files**: ~15 Go files
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: 10+
- **API Endpoints Implemented**: 5 (Items CRUD)
- **API Endpoints Planned**: 20+
- **Test Coverage**: 100% for Items (backend)
- **Lines of Code**: 
  - Frontend: ~3500+
  - Backend: ~1000+

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Page load time: <2s
- [ ] API response time: <200ms
- [ ] Photo upload: <5s per photo
- [ ] Bundle size: <500KB

## Known Issues

### High Priority
1. ~~No backend implementation~~ âœ… Backend partially implemented
2. No authentication system
3. ~~All data is client-side only~~ âœ… Items using real backend
4. Jobs and Templates still using mock data

### Medium Priority
1. Form validation is minimal
2. No error boundaries
3. Limited accessibility features
4. Need to implement remaining API endpoints

### Low Priority
1. Some TypeScript types could be stricter
2. CSS could be optimized
3. ~~Missing loading animations~~ âœ… Added loading states

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Set up Go backend project
2. Design PostgreSQL schema
3. Implement basic CRUD APIs
4. Add authentication

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Complete backend API
2. Integrate frontend with backend
3. Deploy to Digital Ocean
4. Basic testing

### Long Term (1+ month)
1. Wave integration
2. Advanced reporting
3. Mobile app consideration
4. Multi-company support

## Notes for Next Developer/Claude

1. **Start with**: Backend setup following the structure in CLAUDE.md
2. **Priority**: Get basic CRUD working before adding complex features
3. **Remember**: Keep frontend and backend completely separated
4. **Test**: Each API endpoint before frontend integration
5. **Document**: Update this file after each session
